         indexOf will iterate through the array and compare each element, so for
         array length n, we're going to make on average n/2 comparisons, so
         indexOf by itself is linear complexity.
         We're iterating through the whole set of numbers and calling indexOf
         each time, i.e. we'll do average n/2 comparisons n times, so it's
         n*(n/2) == (n^2)/2
         But that's not obvious from the code at first glance, we have to have a
         bit of insight into how indexOf operates under the hood.
         A good way to get that insight is to say "how would I implement indexOf
         if it didn't exist?" and working it through in your head.
